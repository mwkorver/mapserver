# MapServer

This is UMN MapServer behind Nginx using FastCGI in a Docker container.
The goal of this project is to simplify the instantiation of a WMS service able to serve a large collection of orthoimagery. 
This repo is based on srounet/docker-mapserver. I have swapped out Apache with Nginx, and taken out PHP. You could use the same general pattern to serve WFS by running this container on top of a number of PostgreSQL read-replicas running on Amazon RDS.

## UMN Mapserver

MapServer is an Open Source platform for publishing spatial data and interactive mapping applications to the web. Originally developed in the mid-1990â€™s at the University of Minnesota, MapServer is released under an MIT-style license, and runs on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X). MapServer is not a full-featured GIS system, nor does it aspire to be.
